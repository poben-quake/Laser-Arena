# Laser Arena

**Laser Arena** is a standalone mod and gameplay rework based on [ioquake3](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3), which itself is derived from the classic Quake III Arena engine. The project aims to recreate the fast-paced laser tag experience of the original **Laser Arena (2000)** game, updated with modern features and original content.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Fast, responsive laser combat inspired by the original *Laser Arena*.
- Focus on 1v1 duels and small team matches in vibrant, futuristic arenas.
- Replace all assets with original or open-source equivalents to make it fully standalone.
- Multiplayer-ready using ioquake3â€™s networking features.
